Dear DEXON Wallet Users,

There have been several instances of high-profile legitimate websites such as BTC Manager and Games Workshop that have had their websites temporarily compromised. This involves showing a fake DEXON Wallet window on the page asking for user's seed phrases. DEXON Wallet will never open itself in this way and users are encouraged to report these instances immediately to either [our phishing blacklist](https://github.com/dexon-foundation/dekusan/issues) or our support email at [support@dexon.org](mailto:support@dexon.org).

Please read the full article on this ongoing issue at [https://medium.com/metamask/new-phishing-strategy-becoming-common-1b1123837168](https://medium.com/metamask/new-phishing-strategy-becoming-common-1b1123837168).
