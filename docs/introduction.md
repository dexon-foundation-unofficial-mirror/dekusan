# Introduction

### What is DEXON Wallet?
DEXON Wallet is an extension for accessing DEXON enabled distributed applications, or "Dapps" in your normal Chrome browser!

The extension injects the DEXON web3 API (DEXON compatible) into every website's javascript context, so that dapps can read from the blockchain.

DEXON Wallet also lets the user create and manage their own identities, so when a Dapp wants to perform a transaction and write to the blockchain, the user gets a secure interface to review the transaction, before approving or rejecting it.
